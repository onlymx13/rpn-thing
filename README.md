# rpn-thing
A programming language in active development (though knowing me if it's November 2019 or later it probably isn't anymore).
Primality testing program:
```
"1-`"*~%
```
Alternate primality test using loops and mods:
```
"1¿1+"«~%«"»»?=~0*+
```
Hello, World!
```
89*357**4-"7+""3+92+4*84*"92+5*+49*1+3*"3+"6-"8-92+3*
```
